Learn foreign language vocabulary easily and quickly!

FlipWord is a flip card app that allows you to write a word on either side of a card, the system is designed to write words from different languages, an automatic translation system helps you fill out your cards.

No predefined card list is given to you, design it yourself! It is therefore totally personalized according to what you want to learn.

Use case:
You read a very interesting article in a foreign language but you do not understand all the words. You then open FlipWord, enter the word in the form, click on the translate button and you discover the meaning of the previously unknown word. You can then save it in your word list and come back regularly in the application to fully assimilate it.
